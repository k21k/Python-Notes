In the very least it has an actual ending.

"1006510","2","3","True","2019-02-25","(***Containing Spoilers***)\nSo, this is going to be a rather long and tedious explanation on the political crapstorm for you folks who don't know Chinese. I'll try to be as neutral as possible.\nPlayers found a seal of the in-game cult which has 'winnie the pooh' and 'Xi Jingping' on it. Later some PRC ‘patriot’ alerted the public and government body on social media. Most Taiwanese think the mainlander were triggered because they are brainwashed to support their leader, however this is not quite the case. While some so called 'patriots' indeed got triggered by that, the majority are not too bothered by that. Most mainlanders are triggered because after this discovery, a lot of the seemingly non-political things in this game start to make sense in a political way.  They start to see proofs that this game hides suggestive insults to the general public in the mainland.\nThis game is about a cult, the cult leader's name has the exact same pronunciation as  'Mainland citizen'. If you know Chinese you know there are four or more tones for the same syllable, even the tones are the same in this case. Then the cult itself is named 'lu xin she', 'da lu' ('the mainland') is the general term for the mainland. 'xin' is 'heart' or 'mind' in Chinese. 'she' is a society. So basically people interpret this cult is as a metaphor of those who supports the mainland. The victim in this game is named 'Mei Xin'. 'Mei' generally means beauty, but it is also the name of America ('Mei Guo', emit the 'guo' for country.) So people interpreted this as 'the heart for America'. So this all starts to make sense to the mainland audience as a narrative of 'Mainland citizens' and the 'people who supports mainland' prosecute the 'desire/heart/support for America'. Which the mainland audience felt is clearly a separatism agenda. The cult sacrificial day is set on October 1st to 7th (This October is not the lunar October, lunar October 1st would make sense in this case because traditionally lunar October 1st is a day to make offering to the dead), just happens to be the PRC National Foundation day and its public holiday.  The cult candles also adds up to 49, 1949 October 1st is the foundation day of PRC. Now I personally don't know if the team really was targeting the mainland audience or not. I personally doubt it is, because this is wayyy too obvious. This would be like a 12 years old thinks god emperor Trump meme is top notch political commentary. On the other hand red candle had shown particular attention to the use of date and details before, you can read more about the various dates in detention. Very few Taiwanese seems to mention this, the ones who mentioned it dismissed it as baseless speculations, but that's probably the major reason that many former mainland fans lost faith in the developer as they see it as a direct insult to the common people, not just the government. Many mainland gamers also worry that such a politically sensitive game could trigger a knee jerk reaction from the Chinese government to completely ban steam all together.\nThis whole situation sparked a full-on online war between mainlanders and Taiwanese. The investors and publisher have all backed off and cut ties, the studio is under quite a crisis now. Their mainland social media account is deleted, the game is pull off from Chinese steam. PRC gamers started a massive review bombing campaign on the game. Some made fake screenshot and other materials to 'prove' the studio's supposed sinister intent. While some bought the game only to leave a negative review before they ask for refund. The rating dropped from overwhelmingly positive to mixed in a matter of hours. Many influencer and streamer who previously gave condolences to the game now has either cut ties or actively express their discontent. The studio has come out with various apologise and declaration statements to no avail, only to fuel the conflict even further. According to the team, the cult seal is a mistake left accidentally in by one of the graphic designers, who used popular online slangs as testing material. The mainland gamers don't believe this at all and insist the studio itself is responsible for their hidden political agenda. They also believe the studio only apologised because they are still interested in the mainland market, which only angered the gamers more. On the Taiwanese side it triggered a wave of negative attitude towards mainland gamers. There are already quite a lot of anti-mainland and dependence sentiments, especially after Xi mentioned that the PRC government will still consider military unification an option in this lunar new year's open letter to public. The reactions from mainland gamers only dragged their already negative view of mainland public into an abysmal level.  They can't understand the overreaction and they think to keep pushing and prosecute the studio after the apology is very unreasonable. Many despise what they regard as overly politically sensitive, and self-censoring mainlanders. From their perspective, it's very hypocritical of the mainlanders to promote the game as a 'homemade game' at the start then quickly turn 180 and condemn it once this ♥♥♥♥♥torm blows out. There are also cracked pirate version of the game already circulating in mainland websites despite the price is half of its international price in PRC.\nOK that's pretty much it. I hope this long and boring explanation shed a bit light for you confused bystanders. I personally think the game is decent. I don't see any suggestive theme outside of the supposed metaphoric names.  This is NOT a review for the game however, this is my mere attempt to help people to understand the situation. Some details may be completely wrong, but this is my understanding of the situation. Have a nice day and pet a puppy today :)","2.3","","76561198129158516","Vic","149","","False"

Devotion has you play as a man looking for his daughter, while trying to piece together your own past on the events leading up to her daughter's disappearance. I won't give anything away, but this is a story where the main protagonist is basically a tragic figure.\nGraphic wise, the game runs really smoothly, even on a old graphics card like mine (AMD Radeon R7 200 series) so there is no need to worry about it bonking your system.","2.7","","","Ace K","758","","False"

"1006510","6","6","True","2019-02-24","I really enjoyed Red Candle's previous game, Detention so I was hyped about this game. Man did they deliver! It's a massive graphic upgrade from Detention yet the same unique horror vibe carried over. Sure the jump scares are sometimes cheesy but there's more to the game that chills you to the bone. Of course what makes this game special is the Chinese culture aspect, which is rarely represented in horror games, or video games in general.\nOK now on to the elephant in the room: the ""politically motivated"" image. Sure it doesn't add anything to the game but I don't think it deserves the negativity and uhm, rage. As a mainland-born Chinese, I find it funny and sad that some of my fellow people can't take something directed at a political figure (whether Xi is evil is not even relevant). I thought I had read enough dystopian fiction on how oppressive regimes can transform the people but this is even beyond the imagination of literature. I understand the part where they fear this may get the game, or even the entirety of Steam, banned given the current atmosphere against video games in China. For that reason I think Red Candle Games made a poor choice: not that they are not entitled to expressing themselves but as I said they included something that didn't add anything to the game theme. However, I do want to say to the players who share that fear: you should realize it is the government bodies that impose censorship, not the artist themselves. Playing ""safe"" may buy you a sense of safety, but not really.\n醒醒吧，同胞们。真以为自己姓赵了？\n你们在一个言论开放的平台上为一个随时可能封禁你喜欢游戏的政权辩护，不觉得很讽刺吗？\n还跑去给《返校》刷差评？还知道连坐啊？红小兵，加油，这个国家需要您这样的人才！","3.8","","","alphayoung","43","1","False"

"1006510","9","0","True","2019-02-24","Good game, suffers from being compared to Detention but still has enough of its own identity to succeed. Unlike Detention the ending is pretty obvious from the word ""go"" just from well worn horror tropes, but that's not really what we are here for. We're unpacking why those events happened, and the world that caused those issues. The design can be a bit confusing at times, especially one point where you get a variety of places to go and each one can change arbitrarily, but overall it's pretty good at subtly telegraphing where you are supposed to go. I do think that the switch to first person is to the benefit of the game, a third person Detention-esque style would not have allowed you to see the small details that makes the apartments feel more lived-in and alive.\nThere is a lot of untranslated Mandarin in the game but it's all secondary stuff, I played with my mandarin-speaking wife and we didn't find anything that would cause an issue for english-only speakers.\nAs for the obvious review bombs, I wonder if these people have even played Detention because they would probably find that massively more offensive than a joke about Xi Jinping.

Maybe I didn't read all in-game notes crucial to the story, but you don't get an actual closure to the story. Only symbolism, which there are lots of in Devotion. I also kinda liked that 2D platformer section, which could be a game of its own. Also, the artstyle of the ending sequence.

"1006510","15","4","True","2019-02-23","An fantastic horror game developed by a Taiwanese team. Even though I am not a person who likes horror game, especially the one including jump scares, the sound effect and art design in Devotion are wonderful. Red candle perfectly reappears Taiwanese society in 1980s.\nUnfortunately, this game is receiving an uncountable negative review left by Chinese player. The reason was an in-game charm said, “Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh Moron”. Since Red Candle received the report by the player on Feb 21, they fixed the charm immediately (v1.0.5). However, the most of Chinese player has downloaded the ""pirated"" Devotion. Therefore, the charm mistake couldn't be fixed since it can't update by Steam. The charm incidence makes the majority of Chinese player keep abusing this wonderful game and say it hides an ideology of ""pro-Taiwan independence"". Moreover, another game produced by Red Candle in 2017, Detention, is receiving critical common as well.\nOn the released date of Devotion, the streamers all around the world has opened the live stream, including Chinese players. Since most of the Chinese people think Taiwan is a part of China, they added ""Domestic game"" on the title of their stream. However, after the charm incidence, Devotion, any related video and discussion were banned in China with the following criticisms to Red Candle. In order to express their anger, Chinese players malicious left negative reviews to pull down the rating. In my opinion, it is irrational and ridiculous. I still see people discussing Devotion on social media, opening stream on Youtube and reading the article about the meaning behind the game. Therefore, it is an evidence to prove that Taiwan is an independent country with the freedom and democracy.\nLast time, Red Candle told us the White Horror happened in 1950s, taught us to cherish the freedom and democratic society we have today. This time, they are going to bring you to 80s. Through the investigation in the old apartment, you gonna discover how the pure paternal love and the superstition lead the story to a tragic ending.\nAs a Taiwanese, I hope the players from other country can give a try to this amazing game which made by Taiwanese team.\nThank you Red Candle, looking forward to your next product :)\nMore details about the charm incidence:","10.2","","76561198920758971","inspirit03130903","1","5","False"

The graphics are beautiful, the imagery is stunning and absolutely striking, the atmosphere is like nothing I've ever seen before, and it's much more than just another horror-flavored walking sim. There are multiple points throughout the game that utilize creative changes in gameplay that add even more layers of meaning and surrealism.

"1006510","20","1","False","2019-02-23","Games are a form of escapism. Maybe, after a long hard day of work, you want to vent your anger. You can go and play a shooter or a slasher. It is relaxing. Maybe, you just want to chill and forget your troubles with some simulator or walk in a beautiful surreal scenery as a form of meditation. Maybe you want to feel something that you could never feel in real life in a safety of your appartment with racing games. Want to feel like a hero? RPG. Want to feel like smart general? Strategy. Want to stop feeling lonely? Dating sims. Want intellectual exercise? Puzzles. Want some adrenaline? Horror games.\nGames are supposed to be fun. Not ""funny"", they don't have to be lighthearted. But fun. Something that will make you immerse yourself in world, different from your own and feel satisfied when you're done. And not feel like you're being forced into the real world against your will once more.\nI know two languages - English and Russian. I can't read the political message the ingame posters carry. And so, I just played this game, not knowing about the ♥♥♥♥♥torm surrounding it. And I liked this game.\nDetention was, hands down, my favorite horror from 2017, so I expected more of the same from Devotion. Some horror, but not as a main focus. Good, interesting, intriguing story, with a lot of symbolism. And in that regard, Devotion was a bit of a letdown. I still enjoyed it, but it was not as good as Detention.\nThe symbolism was a very prominent part of Detention. I still think that the way they presented\nin that game was top-tier brilliance, one of the best moves in games that I've seen. Right from the start, Devotion presents you with\nThat was a completely pointless misdirection. And all the other symbolism in the game was way too on the nose and easy to read. It was just... uninspired. I knew where the story was going after less than an hour of gameplay, and until the end, there were zero surprises.\nNot to mention that the ending itself was awful. Abrupt, it didn't draw that final line I was hoping to see, instead just showing you some surreal visage and credits. It was awfully unsatisfying.\nOther than that though, the game was alright. I liked the story, predictable as it was. The voice acting was great. The music was fantastic. The horror elements... kinda disappeard after the 1/3 of the game, with the rest of it being hardly scary at all. It's just an average game, that I enjoyed playing and will forget much faster than I could ever forget Detention.\nHowever.\nNo matter what the message, you shouldn't use games as your political platform. As a Russian, I'm sick and tired of listening about ""those evil Russians"" in American media. And I'm equally tired of listening about how ""we are so virtuous, unlike those horrible spoiled Americans"" in Russian. I don't need to hear about Ukraine, I don't need to hear about England, about feminism, transgenders, homophobia, racism from either side - they are both equally annoying - I don't need this in my ""free from this political ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" time. Time I use to escape and have fun. Time, I play videogames.\nAnd while I personally have no attachment to the conflict this particular drama is about, I don't think that Devotion devs had the right to take that time of peace away from their players. It is dirty. It is despicable. It is... just a shame that what could just be a cute little story, a fun horror game, had to turn into... this.\nShame on you.","3.5","","","Tom Sawyer","526","28","False"

My point is to spread the facts out and let the truth speaks for itself. I'm willing to have rational communication, but not cynical condemning. My comments are as follow:\nThank you for commenting rationally and calmly. Just to extend your understanding about this, here are some additional cultural ""memes"" that are used in the game design.\n1. The evil ritual of putting Luxin into an alcohol bath was set from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7 which happens to be the National Day of China Mainland.\n2. The literal translation of the cult's name ""Lu Xin Hui"" happens to be Mainland Heart Gathering.\n3. The name of the cult's leader happens to be ""Lu Gong Min"" which translates literally into Mainland Citizen (homophonically).\nHere are just three of the many symbolic metaphors that people discovered. Do you think by making 4th of July as the date of an evil ritual is not demonizing your people? It's very sad that most of the western media only focuses the one meme that could possibly be a catchy headline, but I think these facts should also be known by the others as well.\nIn fact, what frustrates me the most is, the game developers have chosen to hide these political metaphors into the game, while we, the players, were rooting them by purchasing and recommending the game. They must think they are smart.\n-- My original review --\nI've played this game for 4 hours, purchased OST, recommended to many of my friends. Actually, I was never a big fan of horror games. Detention was the first horror game that I bought. It's simply because I like its setting and the cultural elements that I resonated with so deeply. Obviously, Devotion has pushed the greatness of its predecessor one step further. It unraveled an astonishing story using its brilliant game design and helped share the culture that I like with the world.\nHowever, after I found out the drama about the game settings this morning, I simply feel SAD. I'm frustrated to see how some of the game designers have sneaked their political perspectives into the game in such a despicable way. It is hard to see a game that you enjoyed, loved, and cherished has chosen this way of expressing their understanding of the people on the other side. Indeed, anyone should have the right to express their perspectives, as we are all in a diverse society full of different opinions, but I don't think this is the right way. I think a game should be a place where people can drop their discrepancies (even temporarily) and truly embrace the enjoyment and touching moment together. I don't think condemning each other can help resolve any of those conflicts that we have. As some have argued in the comments that an artist can do whatever they want to do with their work, I, as a player, choose to express my sadness and disappointment this way.","4.0","","76561198078509853","Aurua","68","16","False"

"1006510","24","4","True","2019-02-23","Staying out of the political drama and review bombing by the Chinese, Devotion is an excellent, meticulously crafted horror title that is focused entirely on getting the story across to you through excellent visuals, freaky situations and a lot of flavor narrative.  It is a bit short, I completed it in under 3 hours, and it is more of a walking simulator than one might expect, but it is so well done that I don't regret my purchase at all.  There are a couple genuine moments of ""gotcha"" terror, but only one spot in the game that I encountered where you can actually die.  I enjoyed the story, I was satisfied with the plot and character development as it was presented to me, and it is a visually beautiful game.  I highly recommend it if you are of the sort of gamer usually turned off by the difficulty of a horror title but who likes some scares and a solid plot.","2.9","","","The.Dark.God","684","","False"
"1006510","24","5","True","2019-02-23","With Devotion Red Candle cements itself as one the best indie horror devs right now; able to build atmosphere without throwing screaming JPEGs at your face and able to intertwine it with well-written human stories.\nLike Red Candle’s first game, Detention, Devotion is an adventure game but this time it’s a first person adventure game instead of being point and click. Puzzles tend to be logical and non-complex as well as doing a good job tying into what’s going on. There’s even a few gameplay shakeups too, like a third person puzzle platformer segment. There is one segment where you to have run away from a monster but it’s not that that bad, as long as you keep running you’re fine. Overall the gameplay is some solid adventure gaming.\nThe game’s atmosphere is fantastic, setting itself in a dream-like rundown apartment building. Most of the game’s horror is more subdued, i.e. noises in the dark, rooms shifting around as you leave them. There are a few jump scare moments, but there are rare and for the most part are earned. It also does cool aesthetic stuff like one segment where you control something akin to a museum diorama and another segment inside a storybook. There is even some FMV when it comes to stuff on the TV and apparently Red Candle got a live band and everything for the singing contest segments which is cool. The soundtrack is great too.\nJust like Detention, Devotion has a strong narrative too.  Like Detention it’s also set in Taiwan, during the 80’s this time though. Unlike Detention, the historical context of Devotion isn’t as strong a focus though, instead delving more into the personal lives of its characters. Said characters being a  small family and their struggles, one major focus being how the father and his refusal to swallow his pride and do what’s best for his family leads him down a destructive road into joining a cult that jeopardizes his family. Devotion does a good job with environmental storytelling to get some of the narrative across. Red Candle’s touch hasn’t been lost at all when it comes to human stories well. My only minor nitpick is the ending is a little too abrupt but that’s fine and it fits there really isn’t any kind of denouement.\nFinally if you’re wondering about the review bomb it’s a bunch of Chinese trolls getting real mad about an easter egg calling Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh. The dangers of fanatical cult-like devotion, it’s like the whole theme of this game and even part of Detention’s or something. You can’t make up this kind of irony, folks.\nDevotion is a great horror adventure game and along with RE2make should definitely be powerful contenders for upcoming GOTY lists.","3.1","","","I AKU!","713","","False"

It is just a dark story: like Edith Finch, but scary.\nThe best part of the game is good, great location design. There aren't much video games which have so much of this ""room art"", so this game is notable. This is one of the main features of the game, no doubt, and it's a shame that I can tell not too much about it because it's worth seeing.\nThe plot is... great too, but it's hard to explain what developers wanted to tell to us.

I've played just about every horror game I could get my grimy claws on for at least a decade, and Devotion found its way on my list fairly quickly. I'm not Taiwanese, but I have taken Mandarin classes with Taiwanese teachers, and I learned enough over the years to pick out some of the cultural aspects the horror itself was rooted in. Obviously, I missed quite a bit, but I knew enough for my experience to be enhanced. That's not to say that if you don't know anything about Taiwanese culture - and, yes, I would argue it's distinct from mainland Chinese culture - you won't enjoy  the game.\nIt's got no combat and no hiding from spooky monsters; gameplay is story-driven with some light puzzles. The scares are derived from atmosphere and from the story, itself, rather than jumpscares and gore. If that appeals to you, and you're not angry at the thought of Taiwan's independence from mainland China, then this game is for you!\nPrior to purchase, I didn't know about the director's politics, but now that I know? I might buy copies for people who would enjoy this. My teachers were discouraged from saying they were Taiwanese, instead encouraged to say they're Chinese and to foster identity with a country that has moved in on their country and culture, just as the mainland moved in on Hong Kong and other Cantonese speaking areas, to the point where teenagers are abandoning the language of their culture and history in favour of Mandarin.\nSo, in honour of my teachers: 你們是臺灣人.","3.1","","76561198041920191","Vexxa","142","","False"

Let me try to explain it.\nI am not sure how bad it will be if some game has an easter egg praising the 911 or any campus massacre as glorious incidents, or hide words like ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" all over the game and ACTUALLY mean to promote hatred towards any racial group. Are they illegal? Probably not. U.S. is a nation that protects free speech. But those easter eggs will hurt the feeling of a lot of American, I believe.\nAs a Chinese, I might feel that these hatred easter eggs I made up are only about ""political correctness"" and some U.S. people are overreacting. But I do know that they cares about political correctness, so I will gently respect their opinions, and will never include those content if I am the game producer.\nLooking back at the game. No body knows better than Chinese people that politics is very sensitive in China (both mainland and Taiwan). I don't like any propaganda♥♥♥♥♥♥talking Taiwan, and at the same time I hope people can respect my choice to respect my country.\nIf you think the easter egg is hidden by some random developer that's unrelated to the RedCandleGames, I also hope that is the case. But as it turns out that there are many similar metaphors only obvious after we see the one text evidence (one that explicitly writes Xi's name). When it comes to metaphor, it is hard to argue what is their intention. But one text evidence is enough to blow everything up because it is just too sensitive a topic.\nHope this helps you understand how Chinese people feel, or you feel the same.","3.2","","76561198122989376","口口口","21","25","False"

I'll write a proper review when I complete the game, but for the time being I'm gonna help against the bombing.\nSo far the game is holding up on many quality levels, and the plot is intriguing me.\nActual Review:\nSo this is a Layers of Fear style narrative-driven horror game with some ""connect the dots"" style puzzles where you have to ""earn"" an item from one area, to use in another, or gain a clue from one item that then helps you solve something in another.\nEach chapter has its own style to help freshen things up, and the story is rich and tragic. The graphics are certainly passable for the most part, in some areas looking photo-real and others not so much.\nIt has a good share of spooks and scares, some cliché, others not so much, either way I was thrilled playing this game.\nIt is entirely linear, there are no divergent paths or additional endings, which I feel like, perhaps it could have done? The story definitely needs a bit of thinking to unravel, and after completing it, I'm unsure what to conclude.\nIt would be nice to have an FOV slider (as I will say in every first person game that doesn't have one...) but it didn't bother me so much that I couldn't play. I just have a large screen and have to sit quite close to it due to my living arrangements, so it can be uncomfortable with such a restrictive FOV.\nOverall, if you like Layers of Fear and want another spooky, trippily delivered story to get in to, Devotion is a good one to experience, though it is quite short, with no replay value.","3.6","","","Trivvy™","417","1","False"

"1006510","33","3","True","2019-02-23","Let me try to illustrate myself here. I am discussing a very sensitive topic and I hope you will not jump to conclusion and finish reading what I have to say.\nFirst I would still like to start with the game itself, I don't like to work without context.\nThis is a solid game for story-telling. It is not an easy job to draw a time-period-specific background, tell a story within a very small spectrum and craft them into a short game experience. The game has done an excellent job in rendering and emphasizing the atmosphere of mystery and dread. It is very immersive to play and enjoy the story from start to end. So much that it feels more like an interactive movie that walks you through a mythical tale that few have known about.\nBut I guess many of you have known about the controversy that arouses among player base in China.\nAm I offended? Yes. Regardless of the initial intent being malicious or not, it is very disturbing to see them in game. Mostly because of how the ""easter egg"" is out of context of the background setting of the game story itself. It is a 1980s story after all. I am offended not because I want to particularly defend someone, I am because I think it negatively affected part of my gameplay experience from the story itself.\nOther than this I don't want to join the bandwagon of trying to give other reaction or comments that extend from this context. While I don't necessarily agree with either of the political claims, it's worth noting that Red Candle Games is known to produce games that contain political issues that were related to the specific time period, just like how Detention did. In a certain way controversies are expected to be present. Also, certain interpretation of the content has been over-exaggerated, turning them into much bigger issues then it should have been. For example, whether using a humiliating name of a leader necessarily means supporting independence, is a questionable claim. I am in no position to comment on others' reaction, but I think some people has been blindly following the drama without even understanding the context.\nAs someone who live and work with people from mainland China, HK/Macau region and Taiwan, I think too often we are making assumptions, taking sides without much understanding of the whole picture of the issue. The fact that these people live in a majorly different environment and norm of life, with little to none interactions have been one of the most important reasons why we have some major misunderstandings. It is important, however, that we can realize the difference and try to stay rational at times. It has nothing to do with what you reckon politically, but a very basic standard of even being regarded as a valid argument. I do know that we cannot determine anything in a political aspect, but it just pains me to see people throwing hatred and utter stubbornness all over our lives.\nThe rating is PURELY for the game content, nothing beyond.","0.1","","","DragonGJY","75","3","False"

"1006510","34","2","True","2019-02-23","I personally have no interest in the political debate source of the review bombing that is interesting Red Candle games.\nWhat I do have interest in is that the game is great. Environments are few but they are very detailed. There is also a lot of creativity with a few very unusual sequences. The atmosphere is Devotion's biggest strength, because it's very intimate and familiar but in a twisted way. It gets more and more morbid, sinister and depressing. The third chapter is particularly visceral, but what the others lack in intensity they make up for in getting under your skin and deeply unsettle you. I also think that being European, the setting of Taiwan in the 80s is kinda alien to me and unnerving in an almost dystopic way. Ironically, the game could probably have a stronger impact on Western fans than Eastern ones, but that's just my impression. The story is captivating, though I feel that (if I understood the story correctly) the main expedient that serves as a foundation to the plot is a bit overused in the genre nowadays.\nGameplay is very simple. It's mostly walking, picking up notes, interacting with stuff and solving very light puzzles. This can very easily lead to a boring game experience, but luckily the game plays well on its strengths in writing and atmosphere so it's an immersive ride from beginning to end.\nThe sound design is excellent. It's the cornerstone of any good horror game and this is no exception. The songs are also quite good, there is some Yamaoka influence but they're very much their own thing.\nOverall it's a great game. Not as good as Detention and similarly short, but Red Candle Games show a lot of talent and creativity so I'll gladly buy anything else they put out next (if this whole political controversy doesn't have any lasting effect and I hope it doesn't).","3.0","","","FreddyTheMonkey","319","","False"

I don't know, I was so hyped up for the game and maybe that's why I'm so disappointed by the end result.\n- The cinematic aspects of the game were very good, as is to be expected from this company.\n- There isn't really much horror. The atmosphere is certainly suitable for the story it's telling: oppressive, depressing and dreary. The sentimental qualities took precedence over the horror, it's difficult to find scary, or even disturbing. There is only one very brief section in the game where you are in any kind of danger.\n- The story is very straight-forward when compared with Detention. Which is disappointing and kinda to be expected from a game that's only two hours long. Red Candle dropped a crap ton of side materials on the Chinese media platforms that hinted at lots of plot points and foreshadowing (apparently the story should also have involved the previous owner of the apartment who grew insane, killed and dismembered his wife, hid her body and hastily sold out the apartment at a very low price), but almost all of that didn't get used in the actual game which is a massive shame because they sounded really interesting.\nThe emotional impact of the game fell a bit flat for me. I still remember when I first got to Mr. Chang's monologue in Detention, when the truth was revealed and he was ready to face death. I was left speechless, the build-up was perfect and the impact resounded all the way through to the end.

"1006510","38","5","True","2019-02-22","I got put off horror games after playing a short part of Resident Evil 2 on a PS1 demo disk, and I've stayed away from the genre since then with two exceptions: Dead Space (because I had a new computer and it looked cool) and Detention (because the story seemed interesting and I thought that I'd be able to tolerate horror in less immersive 2D.\nBecause I liked Detention so much, and the Devotion previews looked so good, I ended up biting the 3D horror bullet once more (and somewhat reluctantly).\nIn terms of production values, Devotion seems like a huge improvement on its predecessor. It looks gorgeous, the music is great, and the other sounds are terrifying. The story is at least as good, although arguably not as historically important as the white terror period depicted in Detention. To me, as someone who simply doesn't play horror games, it reminds me a lot of story-driven walking simulators that I love like Firewatch, only a lot more frightening. Playing it, I sometimes wished that it wasn't so scary, but at the same time, the story would be far as impactful if it wasn't.\nIt took me 4.5 hours to finish the whole thing in one setting, and I got all achievements doing so. I don't see myself giving it another go having learned the whole story and picked up all notes and achievement the game had to offer. If you're the kind of customer who judges games in hours entertainment per dollar spent, it may sound like a bad deal. Personally, I think that misses the point of story-driven games altogether, and a more apt comparison would be how much you spend on a movie ticket (which is a much less immersive experience). It's not poor value.\nMy only, and quite minor, gripe with the game is that the voice acting felt like it could be better. The spiritual advisor sounded like your average 20s-30s something Taiwanese woman in 2019, and the father sounded like your average 20s-30s something Taiwanese man in 2019. Just filtering the voices a bit so they sound more similar to 80s audio recordings would probably be enough to maintain the illusion of these being the voices of people in 80s Taiwan.\nVery happy with my purchase, but I think I'll wait another couple of years until Red Candle Games' next release before I touch a horror title again. It's scary, you know.\nTo all the Chinese trolls review bombing this game (it went from overwhelmingly positive to mixed overnight): maybe you want to consider why a Taiwanese developer would poke fun at a neighbor which aims thousands of missiles at one's country, systematically oppresses one's international space, and claims one's land as its own. And despite all the aforementioned, the leader of that country is so thin-skinned that a humorous likeness to Winnie the Pooh is met with an iron fist. Is it really that hard to figure out?

With how much the game is stretched out artificially - such as long awkward pauses in between/during cutscenes, unnecessarily long load times, and the previously mentioned slow walking - it seems impossible to beat this in under two hours. This clearly was done intentionally so that no one could request a refund. Unfortunately, I bought the game at full price based on the positive reviews that were here at the time, as well as the success of RedCandleGames' previous release Detention. I could recommend this game for $5-10, but anything more than $10 for an experience barely exceeding 2 hours is just sad, and designed so I can't even get my money back on it.\nOn top of this, the story is deceptively wonderful and beautiful. That might not sound like a negative, but let me explain further. The introduction and first chapter or two of the game are pretty well grounded in reality - at least, as much as you would expect of any psychological horror game. The things that were happening were either actually happening, or a representation of a character's memories that could easily be understood. It was weaving a very coherent narrative about a family's troubles over the course of a few years. However, once you finish the game's puzzle section (because yes, there is only one real puzzle section), things take a metaphysical turn for the worse. Suddenly you're teleporting around and performing rituals that weren't mentioned up to this point. There are some moments of self-mutilation, but the game doesn't bother to help you figure out if it was literal or figurative. The game makes mention of performing a certain kind of ritual for a full week uninterrupted, but instead of an actual result of that ritual, you just get a music video and credits. I don't want to spoil it completely, because on sale this game would be a worthy experience, but it's the kind of ending where you walk through a door into a sea of white light as a character says, ""Let's go home."" Horrifyingly sophomoric and ambiguous. Are the characters dead? Did the rituals do what they were supposed to and it was just a metaphysical journey to another land ending? I'm not sure that the game explains enough to actually come to a final answer. I'm all down for some ambiguity, but you have to provide at least enough clues to come to a single conclusion.\nThe graphics aren't amazing, but they're decent for the price of the game. Some animations are really bad, though, and I feel like animations, more than graphical fidelity/character model quality/high-res textures/etc., can really take you out of a horror game. Horror games need to be scary and mostly serious, so when you can't help but laugh at a character's thumbs bending all the wrong way, something went wrong.\nThe game really isn't very scary. There are some great moments of creepy setting and high tension, but the majority of the scares in the game are simple jump scares. These jump scares aren't usually even built up by the tension that this game creates - one of the most tense sections, a chase sequence, doesn't even end in an actual jump scare, oddly enough. They're just random, boring jump scares that might make you flinch if you're unprepared, but aren't going to leave a lasting impression. There are a couple genuinely disturbing and grotesque moments and sights, to be sure, but they are few and far between, hardly something you want to hear about a horror game.\nI do have to give the game credit on the music and the TV commercial spots. The game's big musical piece, Lady on the Pier, is an absolutely beautiful and wonderful song. The singers they got to record this have wonderful, soothing voices, even the one that is supposed to be a little girl. It's just a magnificent piece that feels so out of place in this game. Please look up Lady on the Pier, even if you don't get this game. The song is well worth a listen. And when the song came up in the context of the game, it moved me to tears. I don't want to spoil the plot, but it does revolve around the central conflict of the family, and when it plays on one of the TV spots, I felt a mixture of sadness, hope, and pride. I really can't say more without spoiling the game, but please listen to this song and give it the credit it deserves. It is easily the most beautiful aspect of the game.\nOverall, a solid intro to a disappointing climax and ending, janky animations, and slow, plodding gameplay designed to pad the game out make this a game I cannot recommend at full price. If I were to give it a score, it'd be a 4/10. But, this ""political"" backlash is just plain stupid and should be ignored.\nEDIT: After thinking the game over some more, I realize I was being stupid with my own analysis of the plot. The game is clear on exactly what happens, HOWEVER it still suffers from being completely unhelpful in clueing the player in to what is meant to be literal and what is meant to be metaphorical. I can't get into more detail without spoiling the game, but I still feel the game's story lacks in character development and leaves only a few very important questions unanswered. To me, it is a very unsatisfying ending, especially after you've learned more about the player character. Without going too much into detail, I'll just say, it doesn't feel like justice has been served to certain characters in the game, and the ending seems too happy-go-lucky and upbeat for the short journey you went through. I'd definitely still say the story is weak, albeit not as vague or shallow as I had previously assumed.","2.6","","","TheMettaur","316","33","False"

Well, that's what I ended up doing anyway!\nIf you like to be petrified by games then you have to get this!

The olden days Taiwanese decor and styling which you can hardly see in any video games is fatefully captured and brought to live. The pacing of the game is decent enough. The soundscape is immersive. The length of the game to me is good enough for it's price, about 4+ hours. Ending has ""layers"" like the movie Inception which isn't bad. And the game does it's job most importantly in scaring the sh*t out of me! lol\nCons: The game at the moment of my review  is still buggy but I'm sure the developers will fix it eventually. My advice for now is update to the latest windows, graphics drivers, set at 1080p and vSync on before playing else the game might crash at important moments which happened in my playthrough.\nConclusion: Recommended even when not on sales if you enjoy immersive horror games. But please... play this game ONLY at night alone in a dark room with a decent set of headphones..\nNote: I played the game in it's native Traditional Chinese language which has full audio.

"1006510","50","2","True","2019-02-22","You might not call me a devotee of this genre exactly. I'm just never going to entirely accept these psychological puzzle-lite horror walking sims' usage of metaphor and abstraction. I swear you could break a fingernail in these games and next thing you know it you're in a hellscape with giant fingernails closing in on you like a Death Star trash compactor and being chased down hallways by a sharp fingernail-wielding edition of Good Fingernails Monthly. Unendingly creative, though these can be, the marriage of normal hardships and events to standard horror tropes and justification as some dreamlike, nightmare interpretation can feel the worst of both worlds. The embellishment is transparent and the story can't raise the horror beyond feeling like it's apropos of nothing.\nMy response is usually one of going through the motions. 'Oh, that means this... this means that.' What is attempting to bridge the emotional gap between observer and in-game characters in terms of how the highs and lows actually feel, just falls flat.\n, perhaps an hour in, the spell finally worked. Just the right amount of real-world grounding dovetailing with some of the most outstanding visual and sound design I've seen let these bugbear moments impact like they were supposed to. It's still not perfect. Jump scares and antagonists err too much into 'because it's a horror game' territory, but it works better than I ever dared hope.\nDevotion, 3D first steps as they may be after the critically acclaimed Detention, wears a lot of its inspirations on its sleeve. Some of the usual suspects in Layers of Fear, Observer's dream eater sections and PT especially see nods. One of the sections is pleasantly reminiscent of the multi-year visiting antics of the recent Transference The Walter Test Case and Get Even. Inspired by some, though it may be, I think it ends up beating them at their own game.\nLike Detention, the immersion into a different culture and time period is beyond fascinating. It's all-pervading too, from the absolutely meticulously designed domestic setting, the use of Taiwanese instruments and 80s music, real-life reality television singing competition playing on the TV and the customs, lifestyle, religious beliefs and hopes and fears illuminated in dialogue and notes. This apartment complex and its characters exist. Don't tell me they don't! I'm not usually a note reader in games, but I read through everything the game threw at me and was enthralled.\nThe game falls on the shorter side, but it's just as well it's an absolute emotional trip for it. The game holds many surprises that just shouldn't be spoilt and it successfully mixes things up both mechanically, visually and thematically that it staves off feeling like a dread-fest or a stuck-in-its-ways walking sim. Even its main system of matching inventory items with the environment feels considered with a welcome extra step to it over what could have been a more passive process. It ensures you have to be switched on and making connections.\nI'm not going to pretend for a minute that I wasn't at all swept up by the game's outstanding presentation. Unlike, say, the one-note psychological horror of Layers of Fear or Observer's dream eater sections, Red Candle are surely the new experts at environment manipulation, evoking feeling through atmosphere, lighting and colour, and out-of-this-world creative setpieces. Beyond sheer fidelity (which they nail for their first 3D engine foray) it's the sheer love paid to most every detail and around every corner that truly won me over. Rather than throw scary imagery at you with non-impactful metaphorical vagaries, the game feels laser-focused on hitting the right emotional note. Rather than be deliberately obtuse, Devotion has a story to tell.\nDevotion feels like a massive stride forward for psychological indie horror. Whilst still playing by the rules of its contemporaries and falling back on one too many horror genre expectations, it manages to carve out an identity all of its own by exercising its exceptional sense of place and atmosphere and mature, grounded story to make its horror excesses work to an emotional end. I can only leave the experience feeling, myself, a devotee of Red Candle. Surely one of the best devs in the business.","3.9","Product received for free","","Alphadoriest","1162","5","False"
"1006510","50","3","True","2019-02-22","Devotion's a first-person horror game that follows in the style of P.T. In that, you will be walking through an endless maze constantly. (This maze being that of a Taiwanese family's living room with a few select bedrooms, bathroom and a kitchen.) Gameplay is simple, puzzle based and revolves around grabbing tidbits of info to satisfy the game's invisible checkmarks for objectives.\nI just want to start off by saying, visually, this game's great. Everything's well detailed and does almost get to the length of almost being photorealistic, but some parts are off. Like the occasional texture that might not be too detailed, or the horrifyingly uncanny model of a character that twitches and shakes violently in twisted ways. What makes the game on a presentation level is the audio, it's frickin' great. With beautifully well done music that'll tug on the heart strings with magnificent crescendos. Or the very well done voice acting that conveys enough emotion to invest the player. Just know, audio is king in this game. MAKE SURE TO USE HEADPHONES.\nIf everything else weren't fantastic enough, the story... It's really, really good, and painful at the same time. The simple story is amplified by terrific storytelling that conveys emotions and strong reactions. There were plenty of times where the themes of religion and devotion hit very hard. Sometimes harder than it should have, especially on the religion. Which only made the characters (for how little you see them) seem so much more real. This game is the equivalent of going through the anxiety, stresses and agony of a family's left over home if almost everything was in tact. It's terrifying.\nAs for the horror. I will say, I think the horror in this game is weaker than in Detention. Not only does the game use jumpscares more freely, the few times of gripping tension are very few and somewhat far between. Though, the story almost brings the horror back into control. Especially since you'll be so uptight about what'll happen next that you might be able to forgive the lacking scares since you'll be so engrossed.\nNow is Devotion worth the $17? For a game that's 2-3.5 hours... (I raked in five due to some down time in between play sessions and bathroom breaks) I think it is. As hard as it is to say for a game you might play once, if you want some truly quality time, look no further. This is a good start for 2019's horror games, and I hope some will take the cues from this and learn from it. Remember, this is a quality over quantity game, and I will say, I was happy with what I got for what I paid. Even if it was a little difficult to want to put the money in immediately because of the length. But since it's Red Candle, I think it's in good hands to say the least.v","5.0","","","Mr. Stormtrooper Aim","518","","False"

At first, I was hesitant if switching to a whole different genre - a 3D first person walking simulator - was going to be a good choice, but developers did a great job!\nWhat you get:\n- the atmosphere of 80s Taiwan supported by fictional, yet so realistic tv shows, advertisements, a huge amount of cultural references;\n- a touching and sad story of a family, where people mistake gods for demons and ruin their lives because of poor choices. It also raises a very important problem of mental health being treated the wrong way and stigma surrounding it;\n- good graphics, many small details that add to the story (but I also would prefer the ability to zoom in to look closely at all those things, specifically, with Chinese characters, from afar they are indistinguishable)\n- some good spooks\n. Pay close attention to the sounds, and jumpscares won't get you by surprise. Spooks are not annoying and are well executed (which is a rarity these days)\n- great soundtrack\nThe only minus I see, that other players point out, is that if you are don't speak Chinese you will miss a lot of details and cultural references, that are also necessary to understand the story, and may end up not understanding some details of the plot. BUT all the main collectable documents are very well translated into English, so you should be able to understand the main story if you are paying attention.","5.2","","76561198055889291","Chlora_Virgo","242","","False"

"1006510","55","2","True","2019-02-21","Truly a masterpiece, one of the best horror games I have played so far  =D.\nThis is my first time playing a horror game that is closely tied to religion,. The mixture of Chinese mythology, symbolism and religious elements that tied to the game are pretty well done.  I love how the game plays with the different contrast of the horror tone and the vibrant colors at certain parts of the game, which is not usually seen in most of the horror games out there. Environmental design is carefully tailored with details to that time period and I really enjoy the small little details like the notes and the rendered TV shows, which makes the game shines as a whole.\nThe narrative makes me tear up again especially the scenes near the end, showing one's desperation and sacrifice for his loved one. Though, I kind of regret eating my dinner while I am witnessing some of the gore scene, causing me to remember about our when I eat late at night nowadays xD. And also, I remembered watching quite a bit of chinese horror dramas and movies with my parents last time, and some of the scenes and parts of the storyline can be quite relatable in some ways - which allows me to be fully immersed within the world.\nThe usage of sound effects are interesting too, like how it helps you to navigate towards certain area, providing information and hinting of danger. The ambience sounds and environment compliment so well with each other, in turns amplified the horror quite a bit. Unfortunately, my tolerance level for horror games are pretty high - but thanks to that, I am able to slowly appreciate the details rather than being scared throughout the game.","3.5","","","月浪 れいね","134","","False"
"1006510","55","3","False","2019-02-21","Extremely disappointing, underwhelming, and at times even embarrassing.\nThis game is essentially another metaphorical on-the-rails horror game (think Layers of Fear) under a fresh coat of paint, and once the novelty of the cultural and religious backdrop wears off, nothing of substance remains.\nThe story the game tries to tell seems almost to be an after thought devised after the horror elements were established and thus are implemented very awkwardly. At no time was I intrigued to play further on (though I did regardless).\nEverything the game does has been done before. It's riddled with contemporary horror game cliches and I fear more games of this calibre will be made in the next few years simply because it allows developers to do horror while giving off the pretense of doing something more ""intellectual"", even if the end result often ends up uneven and stiff.\nIf developers want to do pure horror then they should do it without forcing on it a disguise; if they would like to marry horror and story then do it so that the two elements complement each other. As this game stands, it ends up as an unsuccessful attempt to do the latter, to the detriment of both.\nI enjoyed Detention a lot, so this game was even more disappointing than if it had been made by a different studio.\nI do hope that Red Candle learns from this game so that they may in the future create something of the quality of their first game.","2.5","","","=SomBoye=","131","2","False"

"1006510","55","6","True","2019-02-21","Devotion is another gem from the Taiwanese developer Red Candle Games. Their previous game 'Detention' was one of my favourite horror game with its excellent use of symbolism and portrayal of a traditional and conservative Taiwanese culture shadowed by the civil war. Devotion did not disappoint, in fact, it far exceeded my expectations.\nWhere Detention uses 2D aesthetic combined with side-scrolling game-play, Devotion chooses to adapt to a first-person game-play which in my opinion is extremely effective when it comes to immersion, interactivity and story-telling. Obviously, when it comes to design, the first-person perspective offers the level of immersion which puts the player in direct control of the protagonist, interactions and explorations are experienced directly and instantaneous, with good use of angle, surprises often lies in certain corners or corridors.\nWhen it comes to sound design, Devotion takes advantage of ambient sound and noises. When you hear the raindrops in the background, it truly feels like an everyday summer life in Taiwan. The ambience combined with the occasional background music creates tension that builds gradually and release back at you all at once for a good reason as the story-telling was also well paced. The music you hear in the background coming from the radio is actually a direct reflection of the time period in Taiwan where the economy starts to grow after the war and people began to live their dream life. Music was a part of the culture and many talented musicians were on the rise (Teresa Tang etc.).\nWhere the game truly shines is once again the use of symbolism and metaphorical portrayal of a very personal story, a family's story, where love, hate and death runs its course.\nI do not need to tell you more about how the story will unfold and confidently, I can tell you that Devotion will definitely be one of the most unique horror game you will play this year so why not let the unique orient setting and strong cultural value take you in?","2.2","","","Cisco Engineer","1748","","False"

Definitely not the scariest so I think it's easier to jump into and complete.  Terrific world building, atmosphere, engaging puzzles, and really really hits hard in the feels. Really happy I bought this game. Will probably replay after I settle my thoughts from my first playthrough.","7.1","","","RubbishTurtle","130","","False"

"1006510","56","9","True","2019-02-20","Those bright, nauseating, and sticky days of the 80s, parenting, a splash of Taiwan, and the desperation that has us holding onto those dear things like religion when we're scared and have no answers... That's Devotion without spoiling the entire game for you. Did I mention horror? Yeah it's horror. But it's the horror that comes from the makers of Detention, a politically charged horror that forces the player to learn something and broaden their horizons while being humbled. Westerners get to learn something while the audience who already knows the playbook get to enjoy the ride anyway.\nI feel like I can say RedCandleGames may have topped their last game. Nicely done.\nThink of the type of pain that Mrs. Darling has when she notices her children have gone away to Neverland or that Geppetto has when Pinocchio is lost and nowhere to be found. That's the sort of horror this brings. Not your average horror, but a slower and carving horror that not everyone can say they've felt. That's the pain and sorrow this game gives me and it also delighted me for recreating that pain. Thank you for this realistic experience. Thank you for Devotion.\nYou play as a father who is a writer. Your wife was once a movie star and talented singer. Your daughter has talent, but she's ill. This game tests your devotion as a father, husband, and as a believe. Only the sinful are punished...right?\nThis game is scary on different levels. Be it the want to succeed and being held to impossible standards or that you can't do anything for your ill and possibly dying child. Perhaps it's having a faith and that nobody is listening to your prayers. The story can be predictable, but there's only one way for this story to go and you're dragged along for the ride while wondering is there really a positive outcome the deeper you get locked into things. This game is light on the jump scares but would rather drive it home that your child is full of needles and you can't relieve her suffering. The jump scares are nice, but the nightmarish images of tormenting my wife emotionally did a little more than the lone jump scare did. I mean it also had mood lighting so... We had that going for it.\nCults and the allure of cults are part of this game. Much like how cults work in real life, you won't notice how consuming it is until about midway or until the end. Then things start to connect. That part of the plot is interesting and I have to say I enjoyed that. Special mention for how I just didn't see the signs until after it had become all consuming. Now listen, if you're a Westerner, your experience with cults will be different than someone who is Asian and lives in Asia and especially if you lived around this time period. If you'd like some background knowledge, this is a great thing to look up after you play the game for some extra clarity. If you look before, you might ruin a little too much.\nThis game is visually beautiful. For some of us, this is going to be nostalgic. It may remind us of a grandparent's house or of a grocery store playing a game show on their little tv and switching to those familiar sounding commercials. There's something comforting in the replication and yet something so upsetting at the same time. I love it.\nThis game does crash in some areas. Near the finale, it can sputter out but I found you can have a remedy of either turning your graphics down as you zone into the ""Hell"" area or, of all things, enter backwards. There are very few spelling errors and most are just switching vowels. Everything is easy to comprehend for the English translation so I don't need any special voice actors. The narration is just so perfect as it is, I can't think of it any other way.\nThere's no sprint button. Take your time. Enjoy. Get all the messages. Be nosy. Look around. Look for every intimate detail in your life to try and understand what's happened. There are minor puzzles. Some feel a little like a fetch quest, but you end up going deeper and deeper into what has happened to this happy little family.\nThere are some minor flashing sequences from a typhoon warning light, but other than that, nothing that had any intense sequences to put me in bed. No running. No rapid shooting. Nothing intensive.\nDifferent horror is still scary, but not scary for all people. You'll come away feeling some sort of pain, but I can't promise you it'll be the same for all of us. We'll all take something different from this. I can say this did replicate the most terrified feeling I have ever had in my life, so I am a fan.\nYou should especially buy this if you loved Layers of Fear.\nEdit: This game is currently being review bombed. The negative reviews are not real and are taking away from the validity of the actual negative reviews. This only hurts the people who played this game and found actual problems with this game and not the squealing children who went ""YOU INSULTED MY PRESIDENT RIIIIIIII!"" like American middle schoolers.

Some parts deviated so much from others that, at times, I forgot I was playing a horror game. The puzzles are simple and make sense, the programming is spot-on, and the story is interesting. I was honestly upset that the game ended as soon as it did; i wanted more. This game pays incredible attention to detail, like realistic view bobbing as you walk up or down stairs, and different walk speed depending on the situation the main character is in. Only downside is the cost compared to play time, as $17 for a 2-3 hour game seems just a little steep. I still enjoyed it nonetheless","2.8","","76561198095085752","BMZ","102","","False"

Like its predecessor, Detention, although comparatively more densely, this game interweaves multiple timelines within a shared intersubjective experience of the Taiwanese vernacular. But instead of a labyrinthine high-school as a traumatic site of the nation’s collective memory (the non-fictional White Terror as perpetrated by the KMT party), we have, this time, the unfathomable claustrophobia of a domestic home, driven by a fictional tragedy of a child's illness between the years of 1980-87 dwelling within it, as an allegorical satire directed at the lures of supernatural cures and fanatical mysticism. It's hellish and, at times, unspeakably brutal. Yet tender and compassionate throughout.

"1006510","58","5","True","2019-02-20","After some hours I decided to give it 4/5 instead of 3/5. Also explained more in the Analysis, hope this will help you more.\nI am Taiwanese. I support Red Candle very much, which means I might be biased.\nLet's draw some more lines so to make sure you don't misunderstand about this game:\nDevotion tries to make an horror game about 80s Taiwan. It's receiving comments in Taiwan like ""This is just like my grandma's house,"" etc. A well captured 80s Taiwan is here, but if you're foreign, some elements of it, like accessories or the environments, might be difficult for you to understand. Those won't affect you understanding the main story though, so don't worry too much.\nOverall, I kinda puts it on the part of Gameplay spectrum where Firewatch is. One is here for a great interactive movie experience, while action is not the main aspect of it. There're quite many puzzles, but they're straightforward, so don't worry about it being too brain-burning. In fact, I do think the puzzles in the game are bit too easy.\nThe most challenging aspect of this game, is its storytelling. The game rearranged its timeline and used lots of metaphorical elements, so clearing the game is one easy task, but figuring out the whole story is not. The biggest puzzle this time is the story, yet don't worry about it being too try-hardly messy. It's challenging but still very comprehensible.\nUnder the standard of modern horror games, it does have some cheap Jump Scare scenes during the early game, but fortunately, they put more efforts on trying to scare you with its heavy atmosphere, Psychological horror, later on. It gets better from the middle game. One thing I very appreciate is that they put Taoism culture into the game. Rarely do I see those in other videogames out there. Also, there are definitely some majestic and unforgettable, unique moments you're gonna experience, only in Devotion exclusively.\nThe core of the story, what it wants to tell us, is pretty easily understandable. It talks about both personal, mental problem and society problem which are still around in current days, in almost every nation. So don't worry about it being too much about Taiwanese culture. It's about humanity.\nSome parts of it annoy me though, for example, it's one-run game. Linear. Also, the story is essentially fully told in the end, but there are parts left unexplained.\nIt is also a bit slow-paced. You can only walk around unless during some scenes. But the well-crafted environments and the constant feeling of discovering really covered that up. You move slow, but the rhythm of story does not.\nSpeed of loading, as of current, is kinda the weak point of it though. Still barely acceptable, but definitely can use some fix.\nI played it on 940m, middle setting, 768p, and the performance is acceptable, since you don't need fast action in this. The art style isn't like AAA with huge budgets, but has its own style and artistic feelings, capturing an ordinary old Taiwanese apartment.\nMusic-wise, I really recommend the soundtrack. After playing the game, the first thing I do is go listen to those tracks again. The tracks come with WAV format, so deluxe edition's price is actually nice.\n4/5\nIt's worth playing, neatly made, has its astonishing moments, but falls really short. If you're allergic to one of these:\nI suggest that you wait for discounts.\nBut, if you are into one of these:\nDevotion is it then. If you can, maybe buy it in full price. This small(Only 12-ish people are in that studio!) yet diligent team will be greatly supported by that.","4.8","","","Qui?","132","3","False"

Red Candle made sure that every little thing (books, fliers, even the kids school bag)  fit the time period perfectly (80s Taiwan). (Not to mention the obvious-room layout, furniture, all the texture was perfect etc)\n- Sound design is on point. You feel like you are actually in the environment they put you in, at the same time making sure it sounded like, well, what living in Taiwan would sound like (dog bark / traffic in the background )\n-Subtle story telling. While not being difficult to progress, gives you a lot of time and reason to search every corner of the game. You can sense the passage of time, a change of situation and even sometimes the mental state of characters just by looking around.\n- Character development.

"1006510","60","5","True","2019-02-20","In 2017, Taiwanese developer Red Candle released their first game: Detention. To this day it is still one of my favourite games. Needless to say, I’ve been eagerly anticipating their second game, Devotion for quite a while - and I’m happy to say that I was not disappointed.\nThe best way to describe Devotion would be as a slow burn. The game gets better and more interesting as it goes along, featuring deep subtext and fascinating surreal imagery to tell it’s story. It’s set in 1980’s Taiwan and centers around a family of three. Despite not really meeting these characters, you still get to understand their viewpoints and why they do what they do - no matter how horrifying that can be. The game’s story is an exploration into the darker side of religious families and traditions - and he consequences that these paths can lead to.\nWhile maintaining the same oppressive tone as Detention, Devotion is a complete departure of style. While their first game was a stylised sidescroller, Devotion is a photo realistic fps that has lost very little in the translation. I originally thought their second game was a smaller story, given that much of the game revolves around the family house, which I initially felt was a step down from the high school in Detention. After finishing Devotion however, I can only applaud it’s scale in terms of both storytelling and horror. The game also features a great deal of live action television: including several commercials and an episode of a game show, which were all made exclusively for the game. The soundtrack is equally as impressive as it is gorgeous.\nOut of all the ‘First person flashlight’ horror games drenching steam, this is by unequivocally the best I have played. Both the gameplay and story take some unexpected turns. The scares are effective enough that even in places where I knew my character wouldn’t be killed, I still felt physically unsafe. The voice acting is fantastic enough to transcend the language barrier, with some really really powerful deliveries towards the end.\nThe only downsides I would have is that the loading screens can become a touch tedious. There’s an extended sequence where you are tasked with solving multiple puzzles across multiple different rooms. And every time you enter or exit a room, you’re faced with a 10-30 second load screen (not unlike riven). There are also times where loading screens interrupted dramatic moments and even a time where it interrupted dialogue.\nNevertheless, the imagination, guttural horror and it’s sheer power to sway you in so many emotional directions easily overshadow these small technical problems. The game is rather short, so I don’t want to give away much more. If you’re interested in horror in any capacity, Devotion is an incredible game from a very promising new developer. If I had to attribute a score, it would be a solid 9/10.\nIf the quality of Resident Evil 2 and Devotion are anything to go by, 2019 will be a wonderful year.","4.2","","","The Big Boy Himself","859","","False"

"1006510","61","5","True","2019-02-19","This game. Oh man.\nI've been looking forward to playing this game since it was announced and I am not disappointed. The story will tug at your heartstrings one second and scare you to death the next and cycle back and forth until you're just exposed and laid bare before it.\nThe Good:\nGraphics are outstanding, the 3d models of each individual object looks worn and used. Every environment looks lived in and realistic.\nThe jump scares are pretty minimal, the real fear is the dread. The atmosphere nails the dread which leads me to-\nSound design is some of the best I've witnessed. The environment sound effects are spot on realistic and each little drop of water, the wind outside shuttering the windows or the tick of a clock just hammers in that nothing is ok around you. Nothing is ever ok.\nThe story is probably one of the best I've seen in the last couple of years. It's exceptionally depressing, it's exceptionally hopeless, and touches on some very real topics that were especially prevalent in the 80's even in America.\nThe voice acting is also some of the best I've heard, the detail in their expressions can be appreciated even if you don't speak or can understand the native language. The guy that voices the main character sells some extreme things late game perfectly. The little touches in the voice work like simply breathing made some of the very unrealistic things sound very real. The rest of the characters do exceptionally well with their lines as well, including one very prominent female late game that I will not spoil.\nThe Bad:\nThe game is unfortunately pretty short. I did a blind playthrough, taking my time and embracing the environments and exploring as much as possible, still finished the game in under 3 hours. And unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any alternate endings to replay for.\nThe puzzles are pretty simple, if you played Red Candle's other game, Detention, you will have absolutely no problem with a single puzzle in this game. The puzzles in Detention were extremely more intricate and creative. A good majority of the puzzles in this game are of the ""Find X item in Y area to put in Z area"" variety, and it's a bit saddening when thinking about the cool puzzles from Detention like the phone number puzzle, hand puppet puzzle, piano puzzle, any of them really. No puzzle in this game even comes close to matching the brain teasing of that game in the slightest.\nConclusion: It's an outstanding game, but there isn't much here for you after the fact except to show it off to friends/family. It's a game that feels good to share with people and talk with people about but it's not one you will be playing for days at all. It will stay on your mind but won't stay on your hard drive. Still though, it's an experience I feel anyone and everyone should experience. That's what this game is, it's an experience. Maybe even an experiment in storytelling. Absolute proof that video games can touch emotions that most mediums don't regardless of who you are. Regardless of what language you speak.","7.3","","","オッドアイ","213","","False"

You have to pay attention to cultural cues to understand what is going on and Red Candle Games does a really good job, like before, in explaining and teaching those of us who do not know much about Taiwanese culture.\n10/10 - Definitely recommend, especially if you liked Detention!","3.8","","","Oscuro","263","","False"

"1006510","61","8","True","2019-02-19","Being a fan from Red Candle Game's Detention, this game does no disappoint in it's execution similar to it's predecessor. The sound design and music fit the atmosphere at great moments, and the graphics most definitely look good in the most dreary atmospheres. As for the horror, as a person who does not play horror games often, I would say that this game would definitely give you at least one scare (me being absolutely tired cause I'm a big cry baby).\nSimilar to Detention, Devotion follows the religious lifestyle with their own ""modern"" twist. As such, Red Candle Games weave this compelling story line, alongside horrific visuals and explorative gameplay. As for the sound design, the sound just makes the environment what it is (IT REALLY MAKES YOU FEEEEEL LIKE 1980's TAIWAN). The music in the game is gorgeous, as it would do the same as Detention. Evoking an emotion to the player at such key moments. The graphics of the game look absolutely stunning, for a game that took a different turn to it's point and click predecessor. Almost create PT feel to it, with the environments being designed intentionally for a purpose.\nI whole heartily recommend this game for this looking for a good horror game. The only downside to the game, as like other reviews, is the length of the game. It's a short game that can be completed between 2-4 hours (and as an explorer goofing with friends taking me about 3.5). But the way the game immerses you, it almost feels much longer, giving you a run for your money to all the pros to cons.","4.9","","","王女 Namyy","133","","False"
"1006510","61","9","True","2019-02-19","This is the first game I paid for full price and purchased on the first day since GTA V, and it well deserves it. And I like it so much that I am writing my first game review ever. The mechanism and setting of the game are very similar to Layers of Fear. The protagonist explores his apartment and interacts with multiple objects and puzzles to figure out what happened to his wife and daughter. The apartment and its hallways are distorted are continuously changing over time as a reflection of his unstable mind and fragmented memories.\nGraphics are great, helping to create an immersive scary atmosphere. It is also a huge leap from the studio’s last work, Detention. I hope Detention was made in this way. Western gamers can enjoy a beautifully and properly rendered horror game in an exotic setting. To Taiwanese gamers, there are also nostalgic value, as the game faithfully recreates a local apartment in the 80s. The floor and wall tiles, the TV set, the radio, the fan, the window glass, the apartment door, the chairs, the wallpaper, the mailbox, the rice cooker, the stove, the hallway and its lighting, the washer, the sink, water faucet and toilet, the toilet tissue paper, the birthday cake, the posters…are all 100% accurate with great material details. The show and ads on TV are also 100% accurate in their art style. The cult temple hidden in an old apartment…well, there are still quite a few in Taiwan now. This is a time machine bringing me back to the early 80s and lots of childhood memories.\nThat being said, there are still some minor inaccuracies here. The payphone in the game is a real one in Taiwan, but that model, if my memory serves me right, didn’t come out until probably the late 80s. People typically didn’t have ventilation fans in the bathroom in the early 80s. In fact, that fan looks like a product in the 90s available in new buildings and certainly wouldn't have been in a crappy apartment. The bathtub is beautiful, and my grandpa had an identical one in his old apartment. But it is a design of the 60s or 70s and certainly shouldn’t be there in a supposed-to-be new apartment in the early 80s. Actually, the apartment itself, based on its architectural elements, was likely built in the 60s or 70s. I used to live in one when I was born in the late 70s, and it was already old.\nThe biggest inaccuracy is the match between the apartment and the protagonist’s family. In the story the protagonist was an award-winning screenwriter and his wife was a famous singer. The family started falling apart as the protagonist’s screenplays lost popularity and couldn’t earn enough to put dinners on the table. This was historically impossible to happen. In the early 80s Taiwan like North Korea today and there were only three TV stations, operated by the Party, the government, and the military, respectively. Therefore, there was no such thing like “losing popularity.” They fed audiences what they want to, and the audiences had no other choice. The awards won by the protagonist were approved by the Party. Singers on TV like his wife also belonged to the Party. And the names of the couple suggest they are both of Mainland Chinese heritage, who were loyal to the Party and had numerous privileges over local Taiwanese people. These people were paid handsomely. The protagonist’s writing style, as presented in the game, is for real. And it didn’t lose “popularity” until Taiwan became a more democratic country and new TV station licenses were issued in the late 90s. I was in elementary school until 1990. I had quite a few classmates whose parents were actors, singers, and screenwriters and they all lived in big, luxury mansions on beautiful suburb hills. They had NEOGEO and some arcade systems in their houses while most of us normal kids would be extremely lucky to have a Nintendo NES. No way a family like this would spend a single day living in a crappy apartment like the one in this game.\nThe game is a bit short. I was able to finish it in three hours. But the experience is satisfying. There are some inconsistencies in presentation, though. First, about halfway into the game you will be reading your daughter a bedtime story, during which you will be playing a short, side-scrolling game in the colorful story book. Some may feel it a refreshing break from the overall murky tone, but others may feel it a little bit off. Second, about three quarter into the game you will be forced to run in a maze of apartment hallways to escape from a ghost chasing you. If you get caught by the ghost it will kill you. This is a contradiction to what has been a slow-paced exploration and puzzle solving experience until that moment, and it serves no purpose to the progress of the story. Finally, at the very end, once you open the last door, it changes to a modern, cartoonish cutscene to conclude the game. I can understand what they try to do here, but it still feels a little abrupt. Overall, I feel they can smooth things out with better transitions and probably lengthen the game to about four hours long.","3.5","","76561198168687091","Melamiao","178","","False"

I’m playing currently and let me tell you, the atmosphere and buildup of it all is SO GOOD. I don’t normally get scared when playing horror games but this has me on the edge of my seat, even admit to screaming a bit LOL.\n\nUpdate: finally finished the game. And I must say it was extremely well done. The atmosphere, the graphics, even the soundtrack.\nI really enjoyed the plot but some of it was a liiiitle convoluted especially if you didn’t manage to get all the notes or got them out of order, but it doesn’t ruin the overall experience. (Especially if you can just put two and two together) I only ever really got confused during the one part of the game where you go back and forth from each apartment labeled 1980, 1985,1986 - and have to piece stuff together but eventually the light bulb switched on.  There’s a few well done jump scares, and I normally hate the cheapy jumpscare gimmicks but this game does it justice. It’s not action packed and some people might consider it a “walking simulator with some puzzles thrown in” but if you enjoy a great story then definitely don’t let the “walking” part dissuade you. If you decide to buy this I highly suggest just going for the bundle which includes the soundtrack, which might I say again, is reaalllllyyyy good. What did help me is knowing a little bit about the culture. (Referencing some of the spiritualistic aspects of the game) it helped me have a better understanding.  The game is sort of on the shorter side (about 3 hours) but like I said, don’t let that dissuade you from playing.

"1006510","64","1","True","2019-02-19","This game has been on my wish list for the longest time.... All made in Taiwan, Devotion is one of the most anticipated games in 2019.\nAlright, let's cut through the bull crap and start reviewing this game!\nVisual ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nOk. Let's talk about visual. It gets a 5/5. Devotion has one of the best quality art I've even seen in any videogames. I cannot pick out any point of improvement because the team reached the top. Say no more. This is gem! I've never seen any game that captures the culture of Taiwan so precisely. Literally, my grandma's house looks exactly like this. Like....Wth...... Devotion, you have won my heart. Visual, I give you 5/5.\nBGM   ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nLet me just say this. This game has voice acting, background music, and even original soundtracks. If this game doesn't get a 5 out of 5, I don't know what does. Audio in this game is a perfect addition to the overall experience. In the game, the main character travels through time to know more about the family's past.  Audio effect precisely delivers the accuracy of the era. Even the minor detail such as the traditional religious chanting, dog barking in the background, and voice echoing through the hallway, Devotion makes you feel that you are back in the 1980s of Taiwan. The original soundtrack of Devotion is amazingly good. I also bought the song myself. A good lullaby I'd say. I give it 5/5\nDepth ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nNow come to the depth of the game. Devotion is deeeeeep! I will get to the story in a minute. Im only talking about the game itself first. Devotion carried out multiple art styles, which is refreshing and unique. Each art style faultlessly portraits the perfect story in the game. There are a couple puzzle elements in the game as well, but since the game is story driven, the difficulty is set to easy. Which in a sense is a good thing. Honestly, a non-videogame player can play this game without any problem. Not only it's easy to play the game, Devotion also has a very straightforward, yet intertwined story line, which is kind of weird to say our loud, but it made sense in my head. All I can say is that Devotion is really good! and you should get it. It gets a 5/5 from me!\nStory  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nDevotion is about a family from Taiwan in the 1980s. The game starts with the main character watching the TV and talking to his wife, relatively present time, then the game quickly turned the time back to 7 years ago, when the family first moved into the old apartment. The main mission of the player is to unlock secrets of each year and learn about how the family when down. Mei Shin, which is the daughter of the family is first introduced with some kind of breathing problems. Unlike most people, the main character decided to trust a local religious belief. Denying his wife and not trusting anyone, the family is brought down by this man. Devotion is such a masterpiece because it delivers the correct cultural background in Taiwan from the 1980s. Families experience and suffer from this subject until this day. By telling a story from a different perspective, Devotion shows how terrible it can be to blinded believe in something, and it surely brings people together to reevaluate things in life.  I also give a 5 out of 5 for its story.\nEffort ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nWithout a doubt, the team behind Devotion took so much love and care for this game. The carefully crafted storyline, visually satisfied detail, and truth staying culture, Devotion successfully provides its players something refreshing and amazing! Devotion earns a 5/5 effort from me.\nSo the total score for Devotion is 5 stars. I am so lucky to review a such beautifully crafted game, let alone is done by my people in Taiwan! Truly an honor to see Devotion come out. This is a must play game in 2019!!\nThere you go, guys. My review for Devotion. You can get the game on Steam now! Let me know what you think and tell me the games you want me to review next. Thank you for watching and I'll catch you guys later.

They both showcases extensive Taiwanese culture in the 80s and the general folklore here, they both are horror games with a focus on telling a (rather tragic) story, and with puzzle elements lightly intertwined in it, but of course other than these aspects, these games are not connected at all.\nI guess the most distinct part of this game is still the cultural setting and the narrative to most of the English speakers, so I'll start here. Their previous title Detention is a horror / love story set in a political unease background in 80s' Taiwan, but this time it's somewhat different -- it's is instead constructed from a plethora of 80s Taiwanese people's daily life struggle.\nTo me, this resonates tremendously -- the visiting of relatives when you just don't want to talk to them as a child; the failure of an ordinary man as a father and a husband; the struggle of a retire-because-of-marriage woman when she tries to hold things in the house together; the social pressure from your peers or teachers or mentors; the urge to be a standard model student; the lies you have to tell your kids when you suddenly can't bring them to a field trip. As life goes on, these little things pile on simultaneously and continuously. And there will be a breaking point. There is a breaking point. Devotion weaves these things together in Taiwanese point of view, using the supernatural / folklore elements as the protagonist's emotional way out in the story, but things can not necessarily be redeemed just by praying.\nDevotion sort of 'upgraded' in terms of production value, being a full 3D, first-person game with AA quality. If you like the attention to detail in visual aspects in this type of games, and also you are interested in different cultures, it won't disappoint you. And the audio design is very up there as well, with excellent ambient audio, detailed sound effects and also beautiful music when certain events happen to compliment its visual parts.\nWith even more in-game texts to read than Detention, I am also glad that the English localization I think is actually even better in Devotion than Detention in terms of fluency -- still, quite some environmental stuff won't be readable if you are not reading in Chinese, but all the interactive objects and flavor texts around them are well done.\nIt's not to say that the game have no downsides, unfortunately. The pace of the last act of the game is somewhat rushed, with changes in overall tone a bit rapidly between scenes, definitely not as organized as previous acts. But with all things considered, I guess the game still provided me with a good enough closure. Still highly recommended.","4.3","","","arch.jslin","305","","False"
"1006510","64","3","True","2019-02-19","Haven't finished the game yet (I'm currently mustering up the courage to continue) but I'm digging the creepy vibes it's giving me. Being Taiwanese myself, I love how the dev faithfully recreated familiar and warm environments  of 1980s Taiwan and twisted them into something truly unsettling. The sound design (especially the dialogue) is well done and the graphics and style of play takes a lot of inspiration from P.T, which is never a bad thing for this kind of game.\nIf you were a fan of P.T., Detention, and similar horror games, give Devotion a try. I'll be diving back in once I recover.","3.4","","","Plumpi","556","","False"

"1006510","64","6","True","2019-02-19","I played Red Candle's other game, Detention, and was so absolutely floored by the experience that the game made it after one playthrough into my top five favourite games of all time. So naturally, the announcement for Devotion had me super excited-- I had high hopes for this game, and I was not disappointed in the slightest!\nRed Candle has a knack for weaving powerful stories and telling them in unique, interesting ways. The tale that unfolds in Devotion is a chilling look at how far one's faith can take them-- sometimes, too far.\nVisually, the graphics are stellar and the attention to detail in this game is astonishing: there is so much to take in and admire, and the localization team did a wonderful job transcribing the most important notes and details so that English players don't miss out. From an audio standpoint, I definitely recommend playing with your best headphones-- the ambiance and soundtrack are as effective as Detention's in their goal of making your skin crawl or adding just the right note in the many haunting atmospheres you'll stumble into.\nI was captivated, on edge, and fascinated every moment. This is definitely a title I'll be playing more than once; I DEFINITELY look forward to what Red Candle brings to the table in the future!","2.8","","","Leviticus","85","","False"

"1006510","64","8","True","2019-02-19","10/10\nThe whole game reeks the sweet corruption of Taiwanese culture.\nA Taiwan horror story.\nThe way Red Candle tells this story just check every aspects of my expection for Cyberpunk2077.\nWhen I see in the cast that they actually got a full crew for these 1min clip showed in TV. One should drink to that.\nThe part keep me wake at night is that I can see this story happen in real life in Far East families (Taiwan, China, and Korea), even in nowadays. That's the telling of a good horror.\nA must if you want a taste of the bitter sweet Orient.\nP.S. the music and art works are just sweet.\nAnd Bravo! Bravo sir on calling out Winnie the Pooh.\nA slap on the face of all these appeseist lap dogs of the above mentioned Pooh.","2.8","","","Stimub","158","","False"

I remember I was genuinely surprised by this section of the game when the character walked into a long hallway with bright red light and Chinese charms all over the wall. I fell in love with this game at that moment simply because of how faithfully the dev has transfer the Taiwanese culture and looks into this game.\nI'm really sad that this game is incredibly short / does not have a bigger picture behind the plot like the White Terror setting they did with their last game. But wow, Red Candle is such an amazing dev that clearly pours love into their games.\nplease play detention if you haven't and yea, devotion is worthy of your time if you're a big horror fan\nlastly, rip 紅龍魚,光喜自德,感恩陸上師 <3\n跟慈姑觀音求赤燭遊戲賣得好 快快出續作\nhave fun\n----updated after the review bomb incident----\nin case you didn't know, this game got review bombed by many angry Chinese for having one of the in game sprite reads ""Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh""\nall I got to say is...get off your high horses and give a game true credits for presenting an actual fun game. People review bombing a ""game"" is probably the worst way of expressing their political agenda and I truly condemned every Chinese person that review bombed this game.
